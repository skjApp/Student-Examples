<!--Mouse Event Demo by student Nikhil Ranjan of USIT, IP University, Delhi -->

<!--Welcome To Mouse Event Demo-->
<!--Mouse has three basic events like mousemove, mouseup, mousedown and there are
more but we will talk about these three only.
To capture mouse event U have to set up a EventHandler.
EventHandler is a function which get called each time an event get fired(event occured).
Events can be associated with any HTML element.
In our demo we associate events or in other words listen to the events from a particular
div element with id : demo. The code is explained in script section  -->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<title>Mouse Event Demo</title>
<style>
/* we have to write some style to size the divs and place the divs at correct position */
#demo{
 width: 250px;
 height: 250px;
 margin: 5% auto;
 background-color: pink;
}
#pos{
font-family:Arial,sans-serif;
width:220px;
background-color:pink;
margin: 0 auto;
}
#click{
width:5px;
height:5px;
background-color:black;
display:none;
position:relative;
}
</style>

<body>
<div id="demo"></div>
<div id="pos"></div>
<div id="click"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
	//To listen to mouse events for a div first we have to get its refrence
	//that is done by getElementByID
	var demoDiv = document.getElementById('demo');
	var posDiv = document.getElementById('pos');
	var clickDiv = document.getElementById('click');
	
	//after getting the refrence we can associate events to it.
	//There are many ways to associate events to elements. But the best way is to us 
	//standard javascript API "addEventlistner". This function get name of the event being associated
	//as the first argument, function being called as second argument, and third argument is hi-fi stuff for you 
	//guys so you don't have to worry about it Just use false. It has something to do with bubbling up the events.
	//So now we are listening to the events
	demoDiv.addEventListener("mousemove",onMouseMove,false);
	demoDiv.addEventListener("click",onClick,false);
	demoDiv.addEventListener("mouseup",onMouseUp,false);
	demoDiv.addEventListener("mousedown",onMouseDown,false);
	
	var color = 0xfff;
	//this function called on moving the mouse on the colored div
	//this changes the background color
	//and also report the mouse absolute position from the top left of the windows.
	function onMouseMove(e){
		//the argument e that is received by the function contains a lot of info about the event
		//i recommend using web developers tools like "FireBug" for mozilla or developer console for chrome or opera and select console
		//you can see the message mouse move in the console
		console.log('Mouse Moved');
		//you can also insert a breakpoint and inspect the value of e
		//e is a object with properties like clientX,Y
		posDiv.innerHTML = "Mouse Moved at X:"+e.clientX+" Y:"+e.clientY; 
		color--;
		if(color<=0x100) color = 0xfff;	
		//backgroud color is changing with each click
		demoDiv.style.backgroundColor = '#'+color.toString(16);
		
	}
	//here we are listening for mouse clicks
	function onClick(e){
		console.log('Mouse Clicked');
		demoDiv.style.background.color = 'blue';
		posDiv.innerHTML = "Mouse Clicked at X:"+e.clientX+" Y:"+e.clientY; 
		
		//a small div with black color is placed at the click position
		clickDiv.style.display = 'block';
		clickDiv.style.position = 'absolute';
		clickDiv.style.left = e.clientX+'px';
		clickDiv.style.top = e.clientY+'px';
	}
	
	//Mouse up event
	//check web console
	function onMouseUp(e){
	 console.log("MouseUp");
	}
	//Mouse Down event
	//check web console
	function onMouseDown(e){
	 console.log("MouseDown");
